## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
breweries<-read.csv(file="Breweries.csv")
beers<-read.csv(file="Beers.csv")
```

## Brewery count by state, in decreasing order

```{r}
sort(table(breweries$State), decreasing = TRUE)
```

## A sample of the dataset used in our analysis

```{r}
breweries$Brewery_id<-breweries$Brew_ID
breweries<-breweries[,-1]
BreweriesAndBeers<-merge(breweries, beers, by="Brewery_id")
BreweriesAndBeers$BreweryName<-BreweriesAndBeers$Name.x
BreweriesAndBeers$BeerName<-BreweriesAndBeers$Name.y
BreweriesAndBeers<-BreweriesAndBeers[,c(-2, -5)]
head(BreweriesAndBeers, 6)
```
